# Predict-survival-on-the-Titanic
Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Here we use a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
